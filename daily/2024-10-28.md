Moving into my apartment soon, can't wait

Stuff I want to prioritize when I get there:

1. Eat healthy--cook simple, wholesome meals.
2. Exercise--go to the gym, join the climbing gym, ride bike to PF in the morning
3. Sleep well--aim for 8 hours and go to bed at the same time each night (9-9:30 seems good for my internal clock)
4. Programming
	- This one has many facets, but there are a few things I want to focus on:
		- Build out Svelte/Go app using embedding tech 
		- Do elements of programming interviews in python book
		- Grind leetcode--one a day at least
		- Start on "from scratch" project in C
5. Relationships--make a new friend or a new girlfriend






















I am also excited to play some video games when I am settled in. Dave the Diver was getting really fun and exciting. I have a solid rim world game going.

Some furniture I will need:

- Couch
- Desk chair
- Bed frame
- Nightstand
- Kettlebell/dumbell 
- Pull up bar
