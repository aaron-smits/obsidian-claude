I spent a bunch of time working with the new javascript runtime Deno 2 and it was fun while it lasted.

I found that it was going to be hard to implement new SDKs without long term support, so I am not going to use it for now.

I also just learned about Anthropic's https://modelcontextprotocol.io/ which will change the architecture of the application completely, since what I was building was a poorly considered and poorly optimized app that I can build much better with their bones, and also make the API I build useful for more than one frontend

Next steps:

1. Try out the puppetteer server demo they put out
2. Restart the app with the MCP as the backend
3. Learn about MCP clients
