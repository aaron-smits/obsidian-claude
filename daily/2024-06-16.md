## Moods

Feeling excited about the day today. Going to get a lot done.

Kind of laughable that [Done is getting into legal trouble](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/13/well/live/adderall-telehealth-fraud-cdc-risks.html) . I always wondered whether this shady business was going to last. Hoping I don't have to find another provider.

It's now 10:05 and I'm sleepy. We worked hard on the website today and I learned a ton about cloudflare and the internet more generally 

I'm proud of what I got done today. Should be a fantastic day tomorrow
