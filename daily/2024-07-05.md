## Moods

I fell off the weed wagon this week but we're so back

I feel really good after getting some rest and waking up slightly earlier and going to the store.

I did the dishes too!

I still have 18 days smoke free today. I've had a little vape and a little weed but no smokes.

I have recently stopped Zyn as well.

I am hoping to print and mail my taxes today, follow up with Graham, and get the materials for my passport.
