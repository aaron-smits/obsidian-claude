## Mood check

Mood feels a little off today. I have been drinking a good amount over the past couple days and sleep hasn't been amazing.


## Goals

I've been really pleased with the consistent effort I have been putting into my work on the side.

I had a really nice time socializing this week with Christi as well as at the [[ekaloka]] happy hour. 

My goals for tomorrow are set in my goals list. Looking forward to tackling as much of it as I can tomorrow. 

Some more thematic goals I have
- Stay more organized and take more notes
- Focus on health first, work second

## Ideas

I have some quality ideas for blog posts, I really should get over my anxiety and start posting. 

I like my idea to get rid of Instagram, I am going to keep working toward that. Twitter is better and Instagram is corny and a waste.

The Davis Clark Documentary from Channel 5 was really interesting, I thought they did a good job of humanizing him and did not break the 4th wall. I love when they find someone who seems like they're being ironic but they're actually just like that.
