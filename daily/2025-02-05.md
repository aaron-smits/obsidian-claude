**Journal**

Had a really good sleep last night, hoping to get that again tonight.

Got a solid bit of progress on the API testing setup, should be able to finish the PR tomorrow morning.

I am feeling nice and tired after the work session today, and I also just hit a new pullup PR (finally can do 10 with decently strict form).

Made really good progress on my project as well, feeling excited to keep going.
