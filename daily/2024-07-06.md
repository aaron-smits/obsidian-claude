				## Moods

Pretty cool to see the list of daily notes growing. I've been relatively consistent all things considered. 

## Goals

- [ ] Write first blog post 
	- [ ] Short, DHH style post 
	- [ ] Focus on economy of words 
- [ ] Create sveltekit template repo
- [ ] Edit photo library on website, add another view 
- [ ] Make a trailer for website 

		## Ideas

Update daily note template to include daily chores/tasks, track that data in a central location 

Market a platform for photographers to publish their work outside of instagram
- [ ] Decentralized
- [ ] Only-fans style subscription model with free and paid tier
