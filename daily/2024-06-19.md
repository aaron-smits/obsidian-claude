## Moods

Got some decent sleep last night. Having some new summer clothes is a nice confidence booster.

The new altras are probably the best pair I've ever worn from them. The heel is more rigid, and the shoe fits me really well.

I am feeling really weird today. I'm struggling to focus on work.

I am really keen to get my remaining debt paid off so I can move onto my other financial goals.

I should be finished with that by August.

## Ideas

In October I will need to move into a new place. 

I'd like to reduce my expenses significantly, so I am thinking about moving in with roommates.

Either that or I start living in Airbnb month to month in foreign countries
