**Journal**

Good morning. Lots of hype around AI news, the Google stuff is pretty sweet and cheap.

I am having a hard time keeping up with the news both in tech and in politics. The world is definitely a little chaotic right now, but I am feeling good personally. In my own world for the most part. 

Had a small breakthrough with my work on the POM generator. I realized I could generated it from the accessibility snapshot, which is a YAML tree. This will make it really easy to write chained locators and map the locators onto a nested object.
