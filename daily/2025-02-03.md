**Journal**

Worked through finances today, feeling good about where I am heading. Should be debt free by May and will have a nice emergency fund by November.

Should think about maintaining a separate travel account to budget for future trips.

Daily task list has been nice to use, I will keep this format going forward. 

This past month was pretty decent, I made a good amount of progress on my work tasks, personal projects, worked out a decent amount, got some photography done, worked on my personal website. I also journaled and used Obsidian more consistently than I normally do. 

Goals for this month:

1. Debt repayment, stay within budget and plan
2. 20 tooth brushes
3. 20 meditations
4. 10 gym sessions
5. Bed by 11pm 20+ times
6. 4 PRs at work
