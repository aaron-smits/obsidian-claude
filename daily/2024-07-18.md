## Journal

Good morning. Today is my first day of quitting weed. Yesterday I crossed over 30 days of no smoking cigarettes. I took a couple hits off a friends vape, but we're counting vapes as well as I have not purchased one for myself.

I have been daydreaming quite a bit lately about doing a long hike again. I like the idea of doing the PCT again because it is familiar and comforting to be there. I do wonder if I would get tired of the hiking again like I did before, but I guess I tend to get tired of anything after getting obsessed with it for long enough.
