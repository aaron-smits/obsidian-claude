**Journal**

I stayed up all night, but I will still write another daily note. 

I tried out Cursor and really enjoyed it, and I am getting excited to code again now that I feel more comfortable just doing it for fun, to stay interested in my work.

I got the code generation pretty much down for the page object generator
