Today I started working on my algo trading bot again. Since I have a good understanding of go concurrency patterns and such from my other projects, this seems like a great way to try crafting a money printer.

I fiddled around with auth for quit a while but I am able to pull the options chain.

Now I need to design a highly resilient process that does the following:

Stream options chain
Stream positions/trades

- On position held:
	- Check that the sell condition is met
		- if so place order to close
		- else continue checking until a sell occurs
- On trade open:
	- Check that the close order condition is met
		- if so, close the order
- If no positions and no trades open,
	- Check the chain for a buy
		- If there is a buy
			- place the order
		- Else continue checking until a buy occurs
