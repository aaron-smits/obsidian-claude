## Journal

Exploring Massachusetts today. Went to Worcester and now I am near Concord, where the transcendentalists lived and worked. I can see how they may have found this area particularly inspiring. 

I am parked at Walden Pond and will be stopping by shortly after finishing work today.

Tonight I aim to make it to Portland, Maine, where my parents used to live. There I aim to
- Visit their old apartment and hangouts 
- Get clam chowder, oysters, lobster, and potentially scallops 
- Visit the big lighthouses in the area 

When I finish up in Portland, I will head over to Burlington, Vermont and explore there. Then on to Ithaca, New York, where I have been a couple of times but never in this season. 

New York was really fun and exciting, but there was almost too much going to feel like I wasn't missing something. I suppose you're always going to be missing something, especially there. The business and the social dynamics definitely can lead to FOMO. I also found the area to be a bit depressing because of how crowded, noisy, dark, and dirty the place is. Something about being around that many people can make me feel alone in a special sort of isolating way, where it feels as though I am viewing the world through a foggy, scratched up pane of glass and I am not actually in it.
