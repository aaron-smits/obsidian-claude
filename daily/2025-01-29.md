**Journal**

Had a good morning work session. I got through the initial work resistance by just staring at the screen, and taking tiny baby steps to get momentum going. Really need to remember that as soon as I start something, I tend to get absorbed in it at can go for longer than I think I can.

Deepseek and Qwen news has captured my attention this week, I believe those models are going to completely change how the AI stuff looks going forward.

Overall mood is pretty high today. I am excited to move on to a different type of testing at work, and am feeling motivated to continue my fitness and mental health focus.
