## Moods
This GM project is kinda driving me nuts. I am so used to having control over my projects and being able to move quickly/progress. I really am extremely bored and tired of waiting around for people to follow up with me on what seems like a super basic request. 

Everything from the build system, access to infrastructure I am building/using, accounts, and people seems to be chain to the radiator behind a wall of red tape. 

I feel extremely restless today and this feeling seems to persist through the past few weeks. 

I wonder if I can find some peace if I get a new job, new apartment, new habits. 

I feel like this may be burnout creeping up on me. I need to change something and take a step back. I feel irritable with my coworkers. Their inability to solve problems, and refusal to take responsibility for the projects they are assigned to drives me nuts. 

I feel like I am putting a lot of pressure on myself and working too much.
