Today I got the first really solid night of sleep in a LOOOOONG time. Thanks to my new matress and bed, quiet room, no phone in bed, and working out a little bit yesterday, I have been feeling extra calm and content. Still sleepy but that's probably just winter time adjustments and still being in a deficit.

Now that I am settling in I need to make some new goals. That said I made a list of todos that I skipped temporarily that need to be attended to:
