## Journal

I have been traveling across America for almost two months now. I have been to Illinois, Michigan, Iowa, Nebraska, Colorado, Wyoming, Nevada, California, Arizona, Utah, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York. 

Next week I will travel to Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Maine, Vermont, and more. 

I have seen a broad spectrum of lifestyles, socioeconomic conditions, and terrain. This country really is massive in terms of its size but also its culture, scope, and breadth of approaches to living as well. 

I have visited some of the great natural treasures and some of the most historically significant landmarks in of the nation.
