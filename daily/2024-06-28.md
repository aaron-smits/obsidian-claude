## Moods

I feel really glad that it is the weekend.

I am coming more to terms with the pace of this work I am doing, it does seem like my anxiety about it is rooted in years of overworking myself at Loop in order to get ahead and learn. Now that I have more experience, the work is easier, and the problems are inherently "less interesting" since I know the solutions, and just have to do the work. It feels more like grinding that researching/learning, which I guess is how most of the working world operates. 

I am grateful to have the change after thinking about it more. Overall my stress level is at an all time low. The suffering I still experience is likely self imposed. 

My new boss Ryan is so busy working on other stuff and teams that I don't have a lot of eyes on me. Working with Doug and Brooke is fine.

It's weird that Brooke feels like we're friends considering she tried to get me fired earlier this year. 

Doug is a complainer and gives up too easily, and also doesn't know how to quickly solve problems or communicate when he needs assistance.

I don't really like helping people at work, I prefer to work independently and solve things myself. I'd rather teach myself the thing than ask someone to do it for me
