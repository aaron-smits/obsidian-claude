**Journal**

Today I actually did get some good stuff done during work hours. I think I am feeling back on track compared to how I felt a week or two ago. Still think I can ramp up to do more.  I think I was really settled into the lack of challenge I put myself through, and did not really get put to the test during my normal workday. 

Missing out on challenges and difficult work both physically and mentally seems to have put me in a mental fog and increase anxiety and depression. Need to find the goldilocks zone without leaning into mania or hyperfocus.

If you feel like you want to do _everything_ on your schedule each day, the schedule is too easy. Do something that challenges you until you need serious challenge. 75% to "fuck this, I am done and quitting"
