## Moods

I was really struggling to focus on work today. I did figure out the jfrog thing so I just need to run it/build it on the CI now and get that going tomorrow.

Still waiting on a test account.

I went for a really nice walk today and noticed how much trash is on the lakefront. I think I'll start picking up trash soon
