Good morning. I have been working really hard these past few days getting back into the habit of coding after work.

Lots of good stuff happened this week:

1. Extended contract with Cadillac/Clockwork
2. Helped diagnose and find a critical security issue for the project, which I think helped win me some good will 
3. Commited code every day except Friday
4. Built the cabinet that I have been procrastinating forever
5. Cleaned up my office setup, my living room and more stuff like that. 
6. Got groceries
7. Went to the gym
8. Found out how to use my free dashpass subscription
9. Finalized my car loan refi
10. Based on the above work, possibly secured a bonus 
11. New PR on pullups 
12. Expressed myself authentically with my friends 
13. Reconnected with Nic, played a bunch of fun games
