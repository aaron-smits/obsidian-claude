## Setup

- Create a vault on your Desktop if you have not done so already
- install the Git Community Plugin
- From the Command Palette, select `Git: Initialize a new repo`
- Create a `.gitignore` file at the root of your vault
- Add`.obsidian/workspace` to `.gitignore`
- Create your remote repository on GitHub (I like to use the GitHub CLI for this)
- Back in Obsidian Desktop, select `Git: Edit Remotes` and create a new remote called `origin` by typing the name and selecting it from the menu. After providing a name, provide the `https` clone link from GitHub
- From the Command Palette, select `Git: Push`
