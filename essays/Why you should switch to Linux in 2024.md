For years, Linux has been a third-rate platform compared to Mac or Windows. But these days, what was once an esoteric piece of software has become a ubiquitous part of daily life, whether you know it or not.

It is fair to assume that every website you connect to on a daily basis is served by a Linux operating system. If you use an Android phone, that's just a small Linux computer. Many embedded systems like smart TVs, routers, and the broader "internet of things" that run our homes and offices are running Linux operating systems. Chromebooks use the Linux Kernel. 

One of the biggest watershed moments for Linux recently was the release of the Steam Deck, a portable PC gaming console from Valve, which runs a custom Linux distribution based on Arch. 

Raspberry Pi and other small board computers (SBCs) that are popular for computing hobbyists use Linux as well. 

So why are we still waiting for the "year of the Linux desktop"?

## Compatibility

Popular commercial software struggles to support Linux, partly because of the small market share these commercial providers are tasked with serving. There are many cases where Linux makes up a large percentage of the issues the customer service team needs to work on, despite the user base being such a small cohort. 

Developing and maintaining a version of the software that works across multiple platforms and distributions can be cost-prohibitive for even large software companies, and business people find that it just is not worth the cost to serve such a small cohort of users.
