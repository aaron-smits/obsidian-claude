When you're learning to program, you're going to get advice that pulls you in every direction. I think the stuff I've listed below will genuinely help you in your career or just learning the skills, regardless of your goals. The nice side effect is that all of these are also pretty fun.

The concept for this post is derived from this piece by [npmaile](https://github.com/npmaile) on Github: [How to Get Into Software]( https://github.com/npmaile/blog/blob/main/posts/2.%20How%20to%20get%20into%20software.md_), which I would highly recommend.

I share many of his opinions from that article, but I will add a couple of points of my own as well.

## 0.  Take CS50

I discuss CS50 in depth in [[Teach yourself to code]], so I won't give all the details here. Just know that if you take this course and complete the assignments, you'll have all the foundational knowledge to be an effective student of computing. If you are starting from zero, this is the best place to gain the ground-floor knowledge for the programming skills you will develop over the coming years.

## 1. [Install Arch Linux](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/archinstall) on your daily driver laptop and use it for everything.

While it may seem daunting at first, the process of setting up Arch Linux from scratch provides an excellent opportunity to gain a deep understanding of how Linux systems work. By following the comprehensive Arch Wiki, you can learn about partitioning disks, configuring system services, managing packages, and customizing your desktop environment. 

This hands-on approach not only fosters a better grasp of Linux fundamentals but also instills a sense of ownership and pride in your personalized system. While it may require patience and dedication, embracing Arch Linux as a daily driver can be a transformative experience that empowers you to become a proficient Linux user.

## 2. Learn how to write [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) syntax 

Using markdown will improve your note-taking and documentation. By mastering Markdown, you can efficiently create well-structured documents, including headings, lists, links, images, and code blocks, tables, and more without any complex formatting or editing tooling.

The beauty of Markdown lies in its simplicity and portability. It can be used in various environments, from text editors to online platforms like GitHub, Notion, and Reddit. By investing time in learning Markdown syntax, you can streamline your writing process, enhance readability, and collaborate more effectively with others. I use **Obsidian** for all of my notes, which is built on markdown. Pretty much any documentation file that is built into a code repository is going to be written in markdown, so being effective at writing it yourself will serve you well as you begin collaborating with others.

## 3. Build and deploy simple web application

It really does not matter what tech stack you use for this. Learn how to make a todo list or some other basic web application. As a side effect you'll get exposure to many important tools and concepts:
* [SQL](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_intro.asp) Databases
* [CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) (create, read, update, delete)
* [ RESTful APIs](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/restful-api/) and HTTP requests
* [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_intro.asp) and Styling
* Systems Administration
* Networking
* Linux
* Cloud Providers
* nginx
* JavaScript basics
* git
* CI/CD pipelines
* Testing
* Authentication / Authorization / Security

I am going to be intentionally vague with this section because I want you to go out and find solutions for these problems yourself. Each item in the bulleted list above is a massive topic, but by deploying your web application yourself, you'll be able to get some experience with all of them.
## 4. Get good in your editor

Now that you're a programmer, you're going to spend a lot of time staring at this, so you might as well get good at using it. You have countless options, but it's going to be more important that you pick something and get good at it than oscillating between several. I'd advise you lock in to one and use it for a few months. 
* As a beginner, the most likely tool you'll use for the job is [VS Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode), and as much as people clown on it, it's the industry standard.
* If you're looking for something simpler, I would go for [Zed](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed) which I use personally. Use the docs on GitHub to figure out how to build it from source and install it on your machine, as it is only distributed on mac currently.
* If you want to get into modal editors and fully customize your experience from scratch, [neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) is the way. I personally don't prefer the modal editor experience but some people swear by it.
## 5. Write software

It does not matter what you write, but it does matter that you do it well and do it often. As with any skill, it is more important to do it regularly and consistently than to try to "speed-run" it or do some specific project. It is important to find something your find genuinely interesting so you can continue to practice without feeling like its a simply a chore.

I see people online lament that it is hard to choose a project, but I could not disagree more. There are so many things you could build, and rather than waiting around for the perfect idea, the perfect project that will be the "slam dunk" that gets you a job or makes you a rich, you would be best served to just start, make mistakes, and put in the hours.
