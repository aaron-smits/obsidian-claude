Especially in the current job market, this is probably the hardest part of pursuing a career as a programmer. As a new person in the field, you will likely be unsure about what path to take. You will likely feel under-prepared for the demands of a full time job using the skills you've learned. And you will also be competing with folks who have years of experience in the industry. 

All that said, I would not let this deter you. An entire separate article is warranted to discuss how to find a path in this field, as there are many different skill sets you might want to learn, and there are many different roles you might want to play in this game.

For detailed information about the many pathways you might pursue and the skills you want to pick up along the way, I highly recommend checking out https://roadmap.sh/ 

This website covers all the most common career paths available in the tech world today. They provide road maps for roles as well as for specific skill sets you may want to specialize in. 

Since I am a QA Engineer, I referenced the QA road map: https://roadmap.sh/qa

It gives you a starting point if you are an absolute beginner, and as your grow your skills, it provides a framework to fill in blanks in your current skillset, as well as a path forward to grow your skills beyond the present.
