## False Starts

I started programming in high school, when I took a programming class that used Alice, an object-based educational programming language with an integrated development environment. We made really basic animations and games with Alice in the class that I took. 

After going through this course in high school, I felt that programming just was not that interesting to me. I am not sure if the issue was the teacher or the curriculum, but regardless I found it to be virtually useless in terms of learning a set of broader concepts that would help me become interested in the broader field of computer programming. A lot of the concepts we learned in Alice were not really applicable to other programming projects I would pursue in the future. 

## The Jumping-Off Point

The real entry into serious computer programming for me was following along with the Harvard CS50 course back in 2021. At the time, the course followed this path:

Week 0 Scratch 
Week 1 C
Week 2 Arrays
Week 3 Algorithms
Week 4 Memory
Week 5 Data Structures
Week 6 Python 
Week 7 SQL
Week 8 Information

Scratch was essentially a better version of Alice, which provided a graphical interface for beginners to practice basic programming primitives: loops, control flow, variable declarations, etc.

However, we quickly move on from the basics of Week 0 into programming C, which is a simple but error-prone language to learn as a beginner. 

I really enjoyed struggling through this portion of the course, as I had never experienced this level of challenge in programming just to print out a pyramid of characters. The lectures in this portion of the course, especially Week 2 (Arrays), still serve me to this day as a foundational understanding of iteration, arrays, indexes, command line arguments, etc. Writing programs in the C programming language really made this a difficult, tedious, but rewarding task. I believe writing the programs in this module of the class will make any new programmer a more skilled problem solver, and it will also solidify key concepts in programming that will serve you for the rest of your career. 

The next portion of the class (algorithms, memory, data structures) will also cover key programming concepts that will serve you well in your career. Understanding types, pointers, hexadecimal, time complexity, memory complexity, recursion, etc will take you far, and carefully studying the material in this course will give you insights that serve you for the rest of your career. 

The final third of the course is where things really came together for me, since week 6-8 focus on more higher level, applied concepts. Specifically, we cover Python and its packages, SQL and its applications, as well as a broader discussion of how websites store and track information when you use them. 

Without going to much farther into depth about CS50, I will just say that I highly recommend it The foundational knowledge you will acquire in this course will serve you for the rest of your life as a programmer, and if you pursue this as a career, you will use many of the concepts you learn in this course every day.
